# Project requirements

### Libraries used

- truffle(5.5.6): used latest version of the truffle version instead the one suggested in the project. This is a personal decision to avoid the stress of frequently using outdated tools and provided starter source code.
- @openzeppelin/test-helpers (^0.5.15): installed for testing purposes, to facilitate the assertion of emitted events and reverted transactions. 
- truffle-hdwallet-provider (^1.0.17): installed for deployment purposes, to be able to deploy the contracts through an Infura node using a custom wallet.
